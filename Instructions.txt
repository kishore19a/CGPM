Hello and Welcome to our Speech Recognition Application!!!! :)

Start Recording: Click on the icon of a mike, in the middle, to start recording and inputting the code.
Edit Grammar: You can edit the grammar that this speech recogniser will use to write the code.It has 
	      3 segments. 
	      Eg. First|second|third
	      The first segment is the word that you want the user to speak
	      The second segment is the word that you want to write in the text file, for the word said in the first segment.
	      The third segment is by default taken as false, unless it is a shell command for which it will be true.
              You can change it as per your convenience.
	      Eg. move|MO|false
              This will write MO whenever the user speaks 'move' .
 
Key Words: User has to say 'next' to move to the next line.
	   Say 'backspace' to remove the current character that has been recognised.
           Say 'delete' to delete the entire file.
           Say 'space' or 'comma' to provide space and comma respectively.
